	<h2>Help Accessibility and symmetry contact &chi;1-&chi;2 plots</h2>
	<p>
	In this section the residues are subdivided by resolution, secondary structure, accessibility and symmetry contacts. The limits for being called accessible, burried or inbetween are indicated in each page. 'Symmetry contact' means that the residue involved has at least one atom that makes a contact with one atom of a symmetry related residue. 'Contact' is defined as the space between the Van der Waals radii being 0.25 &Aring; or less.
