	<h2>Help Fluxplots (Flux of isoleucine from section i in PDB to section j in PDB-REDO)</h2>
	<p>
	We compared all isoleucines in the original PDB files with the corresponding isoleucines in the PDB_REDO databank. We studied 951,631 isoleucines that have all atomic B-factors less than 80 and all atomic occupancies of 1.0 in both databases. The observed differences are shown as fluxed between the nine different sections. The data is visualised as a function of secondary structure for both gross and net flux and in absolute and relative terms.<br>
Note that in these plots an extra section (called section 0) is created, which contains the border regions between the nine sections. The border region is defined as a range of two times 10 degrees around the borders of the nine sections. As a consequence, the nine regions are only 100<sup>2</sup> squared degrees instead of 120<sup>2</sup> squared degrees.<br>
In the fluxplots, arrows are drawn between the sections, indicating the flux between the involved sections. The thickness of the arrows is scaled with the logarithm of the flux. Colours indicate the secondary structure of the data; blue is for &alpha;-helix, red is for &beta;-strand and green is for loop.
