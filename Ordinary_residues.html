	<h1>Ordinary residues</h1>

	<p>
	This data set consists of residues in structures solved by X-ray diffraction methods and which have a score of 1.0 points according to the WHAT IF command <i>WSVUDB</i>.<br>
The criteria use are explained in the WSDL and the HELP file of the webservices that are
located at <A target="_blank" HREF=http://wiws.cmbi.ru.nl/wsdl/>http://wiws.cmbi.ru.nl/wsdl/</A> and <A target="_blank" HREF="http://wiws.cmbi.ru.nl/help/">http://wiws.cmbi.ru.nl/help/</A>, respectively.
The web-service UseresidueDB gives scores to the atoms in a residue. The score for the
residue is then the sum of all atomic scores.</p>

UseResidueDB<br><br>

Use residue in database or not<br><br>

<i>WHAT IF command:</i> WSVUDB<br><br>

<i>Description:</i> Returns for each residue a value that tells you
whether you can use this residue in database applications or that
you better do not use it. The values are up to 1.0. 1.0 means that
this is a perfect residue to use in training sets, in statistics, in
databases, etcetera.<br>
Each residue starts with 1.0 points. After that points are subtracted:<br>
	<UL TYPE="square">
   		<LI>-0.75 Bad C&alpha;</LI>
   		<LI>-0.50 Bad other backbone atom</LI>
   		<LI>-0.60 Bad C&beta; (not for Gly)</LI>
   		<LI>-0.40 One or more other bad side chain atoms</LI>
   		<LI>-0.35 N- or C-terminal residue (or next to invisible residue)</LI>
   		<LI>-0.25 Next to residue from previous line</LI>
   		<LI>-0.40 For non-canonical residue</LI>
   		<LI>-0.40 For Gly or Pro</LI>
   		<LI>-0.10 Next to one of previous two lines</LI>
  		<LI>-0.15 C&alpha; has high B-factor</LI>
  		<LI>-0.10 Other backbone atoms has high B-factor</LI>
  		<LI>-0.08 C&beta; has high B-factor</LI>
	</UL>
</p><p>
A B-factor is called high if it is either >60.0, or > 2.5 times the
average B-factor of all C&alpha;'s in the whole file. An atom is called bad
if it is absent, if any bond-length to a covalently bound atom
deviates more than 0.4 Angstrom from the ideal value, and (for this
service only) if anything non-canonical is bound to it. This latter
criteria is more relevant for cysteines and serines than for
isoleucines, of course, but it also catches situations where clashes
with other groups are so severe that the software assumes a covalent
bond.</p>
	<p> The total amount of residues in this dataset is 25.997.920. In table 1, this number is split up into 18 of the 20 canonical amino acids.</p>
