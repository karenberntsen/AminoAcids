	<h2>Syntax</h2>
	<p>
	This section describes the syntax used throughout the webpage.<br>
	= Equal sign. Value must be equal to the term defined after the '=' sign.<br>
	[] These signs represent a closed interval. [a,b] means that all values lay between a and b, including a and b itself. <br>
	&lt;&gt; These signs represent an open interval. &lt;a,b&gt; means that all values lay between a and b, excluding a and b itself.<br>
	Closed and open intervals can be combined such as [a,b&gt; or &lt;a,b].
	Often though, the border signs []&lt;&gt; are somewhat meaningless, because the chance of finding an angle of exactly 120.000000000 degrees is rather small.<br>
	The secondary structure is divided in 'H', 'S' and 'C'. 'H' indicates a pure &alpha;-helix or a 3/10-helix (excluding &pi;-helix), 'S' indicates a fully hydrogenbonded &beta;-strand residue which DSSP calls 'E'. 'C' indicates everything that is not any form of helix or the strand called 'E' by DSSP.<br>
	WHAT IF uses a composit file quality cutoff comprising a dozen selection criteria (DACA-score better than -2; water molecules must be present; only a few residues allowed with missing side-chain; protein atoms must make up > 75 % of the file (not counting waters); etc.). See <A target="_blank" HREF="http://wiws.cmbi.ru.nl/help/">WHAT CHECK documentation</A> for details. Use of this criterium eliminates about 3% of all PDB-files solved at better than 3.0 &Aring; resolution. The use of this criterium is indicated by 'use_file_db=TRUE'.
