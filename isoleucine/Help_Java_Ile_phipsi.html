	<h2>Help Ramachandran plots (per section)</h2>
	<p>
	This section shows a series of 2D histograms in which the axes are the same as in the classical Ramachandran plot. A limited number of subdivisions have been made. Further subdivisions can be made uppon request if you have a good idea. One subdivision that is unique for this group of plots is the division by &chi;1-&chi;2 section; i.e. we made a Ramachandran plot containing only residues in &chi;1-&chi;2 section 1,2,3,...etc. for residues in an &alpha;-helix, &beta;-strand, etc.
