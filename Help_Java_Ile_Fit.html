	<h2>Help &chi;1-&chi;2 plots with fitted 2D Gaussian distribution</h2>
	<p>
	The distributions observed throughout these pages vary widely in every aspect (centre, spread, and peak shape). To facilitate better restraint values for refinement software we have implemented a 2-dimensional Gaussian fit procedure that is based on the Wikipedia page <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_function">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_function</A>. The ellipses drawn have as axes the two &sigma; values mentioned in this Wikipedia page and the direction of the ellipsoid corresponds with &theta;. In several cases the ellipsoids seem not to agree with the distribution observed, but be assured that visual inspection of the raw data in 3 dimensions and at high resolution shows the ellipsoids to agree well with the data. In other words, the apparent occasional misfit is only a result of the chosen representation method. In some cases the ellipsoids are missing, because the data did not warrant an ellipsoidal fit. In a series of cases (most noticeably in section 9) an ellipsoidal fit seems not the proper approach. We have no good solution for this problem.

	For comparison, &phi;-&psi;-dependent values of &chi;1 and &chi;2 for isoleucine are obtained from the <A target="_blank" HREF="http://dunbrack.fccc.edu/Home.php">Dunbrack Rotamer library</A><sup>1</sup>. We subdivided their values for &chi;1 and &chi;2 by the conformation of the local backbone and named it after the corresponding secondary structure element. See Table 1 for the selection criteria. The values for &chi;1-&chi;2 of the Dunbrack rotamer library are plotted on the distributions we obtained, both for isoleucines in an &alpha;-helix or &beta;-strand as for isoleucines in a loop with &phi;-&psi; of a secondary structure. Since their values are &phi;-&psi;-dependent, we have for every rotamer multiple points.<br><br>
