	<h2>Help Refinement software &chi;1-&chi;2 plots</h2>
	<p>
	We studied the characteristics of a series of refinement programs that have been used more frequently: REFMAC, CNS, PHENIX, X-PLOR, SHELXL, TNT, PROLSQ. In some of the pages one or more programs are missing, because of a lack of data. For example, hardly any data is found for SHELXL when the resolution is worse than 3.0 &Aring;.
