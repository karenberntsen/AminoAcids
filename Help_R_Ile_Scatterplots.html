	<h2>Help Scatterplots (counts or mean &chi;-value per resolution bin or per year)</h2>
	<p>
	Over the years, we learn more about proteins and about software. Consequently, X-ray refinement parameters can differ from year to year. In this section, we analyse how the &chi;1 and &chi;2 of isoleucine have changed over the years.<br>
	In the scatter plots, we use colours for secondary structure, as indicated on the individual pages. Mean values of both &chi;1 and &chi;2 are drawn and their corresponding standard deviation of the mean.<br>
	Resolution bin sizes have been 0.1 or 0.2 &Aring;, unless indicated otherwise.<br>
	Please be aware that the vertical axes can either be linear or logarithmic. Further, 'variable y-range' or 'fixed y-range' indicates that plots have been individually optimised or that all plots in a section have the same y-axes. 50 observations are required for a point to be drawn and at least one drawn point is required for a plot to appear.<br>
	Although most plots are subdivided into nine sections, some plots are only limited to three sections, corresponding to the three rotameric states of one of the to &chi; angles, indicated by g<super>+</super>, t or g<super>-</super>.<br>
	g<super>+</super>: χ = <0,120><br>
	t: χ = <120,240><br>
	g<super>-</super>: χ = <240,360>
	</p>
	<p>For some plots we subdivided the isoleucines in a loop by the conformation of their local backbone and named it after the corresponding secondary structure element. See Table 1 for the selection criteria. Since there are very few isoleucines in a loop with a backbone of a left-handed helix, we excluded these isoleucines from the plots.<br><br>
